### Dataset Overview

This dataset is collected in Chicago, Illinois, which is in the United States with data from 2013 to the present day. <br />
This dataset tracks the taxi cabs in Chicago, which are operated by private companies and licensed by the city. <br />
Most of the taxicab trips are reported to a regulatory agency in Chicago, which then collects these information. <br />
Some of the data features include the taxi id, trip length, distance, fares, tips, etc.


### Analysis

To start off, this is a simple analysis of the data and here is a very general overview. <br />
In general, when taking a taxi trip, we would like to know of some of these details displayed here. <br />
First, for each reported trip, the average fare is $15.62, and the average tips earned for these drivers is $1.42. <br />
The average trip length is roughly 3.2 miles (or ~5km) and the average trip time is about 12.4 minutes. <br />
Some data cleaning is performed to make the data more representative and accurate. <br />
Trips that are at $0 and above a certain threshold (In this instance, $100) and trips below 50 miles are filtered out. <br />
These simple statistics may even be quite useful in telling us some things. <br />
Some conclusions drawn is that the average trip is quite short, of about 3.2 miles (or 5km) only. It also takes 12.4 minutes
for the trip, and you could perhaps even estimate traffic and congestion from these statistics. <br />
For this distance covered, the average fare is $15.62, which can be quite pricey for this short trip, and the customers generally tip quite generously,
roughly 9% of their fares. <br />
To extrapolate, they can even be used to get insights on the customers' affluency, willingness to pay for these rides, culture, or even draw comparisons
to other states or countries.
